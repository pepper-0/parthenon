# parthenon

parthenon is a platformer adventure game where the player helps Athena recover her missing artifacts in a Greek-mythology inspired version of NYC

you play as Orpheus, navigating platforming challenges. Athena provides hints throughout the game
as you collect four artifacts, each representing progress (an owl, a helmet, a snake, and an olive branch)

each level is based on a real NYC location and has unique objectives:

- Brooklyn Bridge
- Central Park
- Times Square
- Statue of Liberty

we used Godot for engine, Pixilart, Canva and Orpheus art from Hack Club for assets

how to play:

- navigate each platforming level.
- collect the artifact for that level’s objective.
- use hints from Athena to help locate artifacts.
- complete all four levels to finish the game.

thanks!
