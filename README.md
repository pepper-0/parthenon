### *About*
parthenon is a platformer adventure game where the player helps Athena recover her missing artifacts in a Greek-mythology inspired version of NYC!

you play as Orpheus, meeting Athena when she loses a few of her artifacts. To help her reclaim them, you must navigate various platforming challenges! Each artifact gained brings you closer to completing the game. 
Set in NYC, each level is based on a real landmark and has unique objectives:

- Brooklyn Bridge: scale the bridge cables and avoid the bridge pillars and recover Athena's snake.
- Central Park: search through the park to search for Athena's olive branches
- Times Square: parkour through Times Square to scrounge for money to buy Athena's helmet from a pawn shop owner.
- Statue of Liberty: Fly from the Statue of Liberty, avoiding obstacles to land safely to find Athena's owl.

### *Creation Process*
This project was created during Parthenon, the 36-hour capstone hackathon of Hack Club's Athena Award. This was the first time using Godot for two of our members, and during the hackathon we learned engine and GDScript. Additionally, a majority of assets are original art; we used:
- Pixilart, Photopea, and Canva to create our original assets
- Orpheus art from Hack Club for our player sprite
- [Itch.io assets](https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic) for the Central Park tileset
- [Music](https://uppbeat.io/t/kevin-macleod/deliberate-thought) by Kevin MacLeod

Other resources and tools used:
- Copilot and ChatGPT for debugging and understanding the Godot engine and GDScript
- [Jumpstart](https://v1.jumpstart.hackclub.com/) & Tongyu's Godot workshop during Parthenon
- [Collectible Objects in Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh_8UXjYTn4)
